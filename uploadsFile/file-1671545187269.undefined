A given queue, always referred by its instantiation name ( my-first-queue in the example above ), can have many producers, many consumers, and many listeners.
An important aspect is that producers can add jobs to a queue even if there are no consumers available at that moment:
you can have one or more workers consuming jobs from the queue, which will consume the jobs in a given order: FIFO (the default), LIFO or according to priorities.
Talking about workers, they can run in the same or different processes, in the same machine 
The process function will be called every time the worker is idling and there are jobs to process in the queue. 
If your Node runtime does not support async/await, then you can just return a promise at the end of the process function for a similar result.
